# Workshop 2: Relational Algebra and Database Design
## General Description
This workshop focuses on the use of relational algebra to query a relational database. Through various exercises, basic operations such as selection, projection, union, and difference were applied to tables containing information about apartments, owners, public services, and reservations.

Additionally, an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram was designed to reflect the relationships between the different elements of the system.

## Objectives
Perform queries on the database using relational algebra.
Explore the relationships between entities by creating an ER Diagram.
Analyze the query results to extract useful information.
## Structure
The tables used in this workshop include information about:

* Apartments
* Owners
* Public services
* Reservations of common spaces
# Conclusion
This workshop provided an overview of how relational algebra operations can be used to manipulate and query a database, as well as a basic understanding of database design through ER diagrams.
